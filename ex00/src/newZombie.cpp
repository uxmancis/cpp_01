/*Function: newZombie
*
*   What? Creates a new 'Zombie' object in HEAP,
*   Sets its name, 
*   Immediately calls the 'announce' function to print thee zombie's name.
*
*   About HEAP memory allocation:
*		  路 Lifetime: objects allocated on the heap have a longer lifetime.
*           They persist until you explicitly delete them using 'delete'.
*
*         路 Memory management: We must manually manage memory by using
*           'new' and 'delete'.
*
*         路 Performance: Generally slower than stack.
*
*         路 Scope: objects allocated in heap can be used outside the function
*           where they were created, making them more flexible for use in 
*           different parts of our program.
*
*   About 'new': Used in C++ for dinamic memory allocation. Allocates memory
*               in heap (persists until explicitly deallocated with 'delete')
*               and returns a pointer to this memory.
