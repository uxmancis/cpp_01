/*Function: randomChump
*
*   What? Creates a new 'Zombie' object in STACK,
*   Sets its name, 
*   Immediately calls the 'announce' function to print thee zombie's name.
*
*   About STACK memory allocation:
*		  路 Lifetime: Limited lifetime objects are allocated in Stack, they're
*           automatically destroyed when function in which they were
*           created exits.
*
*         路 Memory management: No need to manually manage memory.
*           C++ runtime takes care of cleanup.
*
*         路 Performance: Generally faster than heap.
*
*         路 Scope: objects allocated in stack are local to function, cannot
*           be used outside.
